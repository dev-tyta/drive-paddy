    The system employs a sophisticated hybrid strategy to monitor for signs of fatigue:
    - **üëÄ Eye Closure Detection**: Measures Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect prolonged blinks or closed eyes.
    - **ü•± Yawn Detection**: Measures Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) to identify yawns.
    - **üò¥ Head Pose Analysis**: Tracks head pitch and yaw to detect nodding off or looking away from the road.
    - **üß† CNN Model Inference**: A deep learning model provides an additional layer of analysis.
    
    These signals are combined into a single drowsiness score to trigger alerts accurately.
